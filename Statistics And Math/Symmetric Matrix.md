A symmetric matrix is any square matrix $\mathbf{A}$ whose transpose is identical to the original matrix, i.e.
$$
\mathbf{A}=\mathbf{A}^T
$$
A consequence of this is that $A_{i,j}=A_{j,i}$ for all elements of the matrix (as computing the transpose of a matrix is equivalent to 'flipping' it along the diagonal s.t. 'rows become columns and columns become rows')
