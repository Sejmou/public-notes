#causality
Broadly speaking, causal inference is concerned with studying the independent, actual effect of some phenomenon within a larger system ([Wiki-Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_inference)). Within statistics, this relates to any analysis that tries to answer the question whether a set of independent variables X influences an independent variable Y.

There are different types of variables that need to be differentiated correctly if we want to be sure to build a correct model of causal effects:
