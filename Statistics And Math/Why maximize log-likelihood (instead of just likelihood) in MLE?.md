Maximizing the log-likelihood function is a common approach in Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). Instead of directly maximizing the likelihood function, which is the product of the probability density or mass function of the observed data, the log-likelihood function is maximized. This is done because the logarithm is a monotonically increasing function, so maximizing the log-likelihood is equivalent to maximizing the likelihood itself.

Taking the logarithm of the likelihood function simplifies the calculations and often leads to easier optimization. Additionally, it helps avoid numerical issues that may arise when dealing with very small probabilities.

In summary, maximizing the log-likelihood function is a standard practice in MLE and is commonly used to estimate the parameters of a statistical model.
