$$
P(A|B)=\frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}
$$
- $P(A|B)$: This represents the conditional probability of event A occurring given that event B has occurred. It quantifies the probability of A happening when we know that B has already occurred.
- $P(A \cap B)$: This represents the joint probability of both events A and B occurring together. It measures the likelihood of both A and B happening simultaneously.
- $P(B)$: This is the probability of event B occurring. It represents the overall likelihood of event B happening, without considering event A.
