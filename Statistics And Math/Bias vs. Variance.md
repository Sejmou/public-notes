Bias is the inability of a model to capture the true relationship between the input variables and the value to predict

Variance is the difference in fits between datasets (“how much differences in the choice of training data can influence the final prediction model?”)

Example: if sums of squares for linear regression remain fairly similar for different datasets, it has low variance. It might not produce the best possible predictions, but at least the “error rate” is somewhat consistent

  
Therefore the goal is: low bias AND low variability
