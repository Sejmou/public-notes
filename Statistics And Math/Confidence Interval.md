confidence intervals relate to statistical tests. They allow us to define an interval a given statistic is expected to fall in with a certain degree of confidence. Usually we use 95% or 99% for the confidence level.

## Interpretation
The confidence interval is us the value range we can expect the true population parameter related to a given statistical test to fall into with a certain confidence level (given that the null hypothesis is true).

The confidence interval is directly related to the significance level $\alpha$ of our corresponding statistical test in two important ways:


This degree of confidence is commonly called the confidence level. It is directly related to the significance level $\alpha$.
