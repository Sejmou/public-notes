In probability theory, two events $A$ and $B$ are independent if and only if:
$$
P(A \cap B)=P(A)\cdot P(B)
$$

## An observation (probably obvious for others lol)
This means that then the conditional probability of $A$ given $B$ is the same as the probability of $A$ on its own (and vice versa):
$$
P(A|B)=\frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}=\frac{P(A)\cdot P(B)}{P(B)}=P(A)
$$
