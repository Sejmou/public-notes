A mediator variable M helps explain an observed effect of X on Y. Hence, X causes Y _through_ M. M is a factor in the causal chain, i.e. it must be a causal result of X and causal 'antecedent' of Y.

**How to handle:** do NOT control for them if your goal is to study the effect of X on Y. Instead, you should spend time to disentangle the direct effects from the indirect effects. Conduct statistical tests for mediation (e.g. the Baron & Kenny approach or bootstrapping methods - TODO: research on methods). Make sure that the mediator is NOT affected by another variable, as you otherwise may introduce collider bias? (not sure if that's some ChatGPT hallucination)
