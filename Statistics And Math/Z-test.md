## Key facts
Because of the [Central Limit Theorem](Central%20Limit%20Theorem.md), the z-test it is reasonable to apply the z-test even if the population variance is not known as long as we have a a _big enough_ sample size $n$. Most sources state that for $n<30$ (in some cases $n<50$), the t-test should be used instead. Compared to the t-test, the z-test is simpler. For example, we don't need to worry about degrees of freedom.
