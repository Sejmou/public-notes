## Why is it useful to define the concept of null space?
Defining the null space of a matrix is useful because it provides valuable information about the solutions to linear systems and the properties of the matrix itself. Here are a few reasons why the null space is important:

1. Solution of Homogeneous Systems: The null space of a matrix represents the set of solutions to the homogeneous system of equations \(\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}\). It helps us find the special solutions that make the equation hold true when the right-hand side is zero.

2. Basis for the null space: The null space forms a vector space, and finding a basis for the null space allows us to express all solutions to the homogeneous system as linear combinations of the basis vectors. This facilitates the understanding and analysis of the system.

3. Determining Linear Independence: The null space helps us determine whether a set of vectors is linearly independent. If the null space only contains the zero vector, it implies that the original vectors are linearly independent.

4. Rank-Nullity Theorem: The null space is closely related to the rank of a matrix. The Rank-Nullity Theorem states that the dimension of the null space plus the rank of the matrix equals the number of columns in the matrix. This theorem provides insights into the structure and properties of the matrix.

Overall, the null space provides crucial insights into the solutions, linear independence, and properties of a matrix, making it a fundamental concept in linear algebra.
