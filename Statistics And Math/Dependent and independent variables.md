In statistics, we often try to find some kind of model that describes relationships between data. 

In that context, a dependent variable is any variable for which we assume that it depends on an independent variable. Similarly, we assume that the independent variables do not depend on any other factors (which makes them independent).

In any real-life scenario, there are usually multiple factors (i.e. several variables) that influence some metric we observe (i.e. the variable of intereset), while there are some things we cannot control. This means that any model we come up with will have some inaccuracy, i.e. a certain error. (In real-life we also usually don't find variables that are completely independent)

The most straightforward way to express a model with multiple input variables that tries to predict some other variable while producing an error due to variations in the results that the input variables cannot explain, is probably a 'simple stochastic [[linear model]]'.
