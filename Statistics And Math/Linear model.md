The general form for a linear model describing the relationship between the dependent/target variable $Y$ and $n$ independent/input variables $X_{i},\dots,X_{n}$ is for the $i$-ith observation in a dataset is:
$$
y_{i}=a+b_{1}x_{i,1}+b_{2}x_{i,2}+\dots+b_{n}x_{i,n}+e_{i}
$$
$y_i$ is the actual value of the dependent target variable for the $i$-th observation in our dataset while $x_{i,1}$ through $x_{i,n}$ are the values of the $n$ input variables for the $i$-th observation. Finally, $e_{i}$ is the error term, i.e. the part that 'explains' the difference between $y_{i}$ and the rest of the sum on the right-hand side.
