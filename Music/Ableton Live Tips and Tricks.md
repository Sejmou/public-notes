## Monitor Modes
- In: best for live situations when you DON'T want to record anything
	- monitors ONLY the incoming signal, nothing is being recorded
- Auto: best for recording, situations in the studio
	- if track is armed AND you are recording, you hear the incoming signal
	- if track armed and you are playing the track (NOT recording), you hear only what has been recorded
- Off: for live looping where you're adding additional layers without the audience hearing what you're doing immediately
